Hi Rishabh
There are 2 parts to the challenge. Make as much progress as possible within the time limit.


Part 1:

Create a planner that takes a paragraph of natural language instructions, a list of tools and generates a list of tool calls (the "plan").


Inputs:

instructions

A paragraph of user instructions

Type: string

tools

A list of available functions

Type: MISSING - define the right type for this.


Output:

A list of tool calls.



Example:

You have a list of Math tools available like sum, subtract, divide, multiply.

The user instruction is "Get the sum of ten and twenty, then multiply it by hundred"

The output should be a list of two steps:

Step 1 uses the sum function and uses the arguments 10, 20.

Step 2 uses the multiply function and uses the result of step 1 as one argument, and 100 as the other.




Part 2:

Implement an executor that takes the plan generated in Part 1 and executes it step by step.


Inputs:

plan: The list of tool calls generated by the planner

tools: The actual tool implementations that can be called


Output:

The final result after executing all steps in the plan


Example:

Using the plan from Part 1 (sum of 10 and 20, then multiply by 100), the executor would:

Execute the sum function with arguments 10 and 20, getting 30

Execute the multiply function with arguments 30 and 100, getting 3000

Return 3000 as the final result



Best of luck!
